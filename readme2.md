## üîç Features

- **Modern C++ Design**: Utilizing C++17 features for clean, efficient code
- **Header-only Implementation**: Easy to integrate into any project
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed API documentation with examples
- **Strong Type Safety**: Preventing common errors through design
- **Exception-safe Code**: Robust error handling throughout
- **Cross-platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Option 1: Include Headers Directly

This is a header-only library collection. Simply copy the headers into your project and include them:

```cpp
#include "DateLib/DateLib.h"
// Future libraries
// #include "StringLib/StringLib.h"
// #include "MathLib/MathLib.h"
```

### Option 2: CMake Integration

```cmake
# In your CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory(path/to/cpp-utility-libraries)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE cpp_utility_libraries)
```

### Option 3: Package Manager

Coming soon with Conan and vcpkg support.

## üìÜ DateLib

A comprehensive date manipulation library providing intuitive tools for calendar operations, date arithmetic, and formatting.

### Key Features

- **Date Calculations**: Easily work with date differences, adding days/months/years
- **Calendar Generation**: Create and display monthly calendars
- **Date Validation**: Ensure date correctness and handle leap years properly
- **Day of Week**: Calculate the day of week for any date
- **Date Formatting**: Flexible date representation options
- **Weekend Detection**: Identify weekend dates

### Basic Usage

```cpp
#include "DateLib/DateLib.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Create a date
    DateLib::Date today(25, 5, 2025);
    
    // Display formatted date
    DateLib::DateIO::displayDate(today, true);  // Shows: Sunday, 25 May 2025
    
    // Add days to a date
    DateLib::Date futureDate = DateLib::DateManipulator::addDays(today, 45);
    DateLib::DateIO::displayDate(futureDate);  // Shows: 9 July 2025
    
    // Check if date is a weekend
    bool isWeekend = DateLib::DateCalculator::isWeekend(today);
    std::cout << "Is weekend? " << (isWeekend ? "Yes" : "No") << std::endl;
    
    // Generate a month calendar
    DateLib::CalendarGenerator::displayMonthCalendar(5, 2025);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Features

- Day of year calculation
- Date range operations
- Date comparison
- Leap year calculation
- Day counting between dates

For complete documentation, see the [DateLib Documentation](docs/datelib.md).
